- Get into **crossed hands** can be started nicely enchufla lasso (switch hands during lasso)

fake ochenta ocho - cross hands vuelta, enchufla, runde (lift both arms), 123 she spins and I am behind here (567 cubanita), then do 2 cubanitas but with some weird tapping, get out enchufla and sombrero finish

Chocolate (Sombrero start, hand on back)

Settenta (spinning around, vascilala start)
Settenta con una (gancho, no spin for me)
Settenta con una, coca cola, lasso

Settenta con una, double hand spin, hand over head

Dame elegante - exibila, coca cola (let go right hand, coca cola, hand over head)

Superman hand - enchufla, cuban hold sacala (hand on right sholder) push follower in torso close to me, lead for spin, double spin 123 + 567, hand on right sholder dile que no

Close postion "di le que no" - on line turn on 6-7 - 180° + 270°
Close position sacala - on line turn (raise hand early) 180° + 270°
Close position coca cola, turn on 5, "catch" (hand on back) on 7
---
KEEP UP on 6-7 with follower
Close position
- hips above feet
- basics like walking, no foot to foot
- good frame, hand on shoulderblade, firm

Daedo - sombrero start, 1. spin 123, 2. spin 567, right hand right shoulder, I put out my left in front

Daedo end hold, cross basic - I start with my right (THINK, end daedo with weight on both feet)
Daedo end hold, sacala - normal sacala 123, on 567 starting sending her back like in sombrero doble, do the turn like in sombrero doble, put "hat" over her head
- variation, end with sombrero ending hands

Walk move - cuban hold di le que no, swap hands on 5, forward on 6,7 (push follower hand forward), use 123 to get to di le que no position (swap to cuban hold), repeat from start

Di le que no spin move - 123 normal di le que no start (on 3/4 prepare to pull her, not push like normal), on 5 step really forward and complete the pull causing her to step backward, 67 123 walk forward in cricle, strong frame and shoulderblade contact, 567 twist to the right a lot, complete di le que no

Daedo - switch to right hand on 8, sombrero like on 123 - pull forward on 1, turn her clockwise 23, I step away on 1 (left hand taps shoulder on 1/2), she walks 567 to my side, my hand over her head and on back

Daedo + enchufla, runde - normal daedo, instead of hand going over head stop above head and bring down in front, then enchufla 123 and runde 567, switch hand at some point

Mano a mano - dile que no steps but I hold her left with my right, on 5 push counter clockwise (vascilala in other direction)

Camina - dile que no start but on 23 give a lot of space so she walks under your hand, keep pulling with that hand in the direction, on 1 you kinda get parallel with her (you are on her left), 23 walk backwards and keep pulling, and repeat until you finish with dile que no

Long dile que no - on 1 step to the right of the follower, long 3, 5 on spot, 67 forwards, keep tension and pulling her forward
- ideally start with normal dile que no and use momentum from it
- coca cola can be done also
- get out of it by staying on spot 67, nice to go into vuelta after
