## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- From [[Dile Que No Position]]
- 123 - Start [[Dile Que No]]
- 5 - Push with right hand
	- Lift left and do the turning impulse
	- 1 finger hold (index, or middle)
- 6 / 6.5 - Another turn impulse
- 7 - Finish the turn, *collect* with the right on her back
	- During the 567 I walk with her and end up on the other side (from where I started)
	- After pushing with the right keep it in a half circle around her so she dosen't leave too far away
---
- Keep the hand above the follower (if they are short don't lift to high)
	- The followers arm should be around 90°
