## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- Do [[Montadito]]
- 567 - When you are finishing the arms stuff, on 67 drop them both back (her left on my left side and her right on my right side)
	- I catch them and we are in a [[Cubanito]] like position
- 123 - Start [[Setenta]] from this reversed position
	- My left arm goes on my back, as far as it can go to the side
- 567 - She turns in and we are side to side
	- Very weird position you must be close
- 123 - Walk in this position
- 567 - Unroll, I go under my right hand, we are now in [[Hammerlock]]
	- Hand on her back maybe needs to change hold because it's weird
- 123 - [[Enchufla]]
- 567 - [[Sombrero Finish]] or [[Alternative Sombrero Finish]]
