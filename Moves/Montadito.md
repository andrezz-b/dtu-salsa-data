## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- 567 - Roll in, her right over my head and on left shoulder, my left stays down
	- 123 - Can be literally anything, but you need 2 hands non crossed for the 567
- 1 - Left arm over head (now it's on my left)
	- Also step
- 2 - Step
- 3 - Right arm over head (to my right shoulder)
	- Also step
- 5 - Left arm back over head (back where it came from)
	- Also step
- 6 - Right over head (to my left shoulder)
	- Also step
- 7 - Right over head again, and I turn towards her
- Exit with [[Enchufla]]
---
- Go BIG (if the song allows)
- Hack - just keep tossing one arm from side to side (not as nice but works)
- In reality the hand over head stuff can be whatever you think off, and it can go for few more 8 counts - just be sure that you end on 7 and turn towards the partner for the next thing
