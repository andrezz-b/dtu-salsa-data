## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- Start from [[Dile Que No Position]]
- 123 - [[Dile Que No]]
- 567 - Open up, you should be looking inside the circle
	- There should be space in front of me so the follower can walk
- 1 - Make her step back
- 23 - Pull forward, prepare hands for [[Vuelta]]
- 567 - Do [[Vuelta]] on the go (she keeps walking)
	- For smoothens turn with one hand after the other (don't lift them too high)
	- 7 - I start going forward
	- My right hand goes over my head (like [[Corona Finish]])
- 123 - Cross forwards and *unroll* from the right hand
- 4/5 - [[Gancho]] with the left hand
	- This is optional but looks nice
- 567 - Cross behind
	- 7 - Right hand on her head ([[Corona Finish]] for her)
	- Keep the [[Gancho]] until 1
- 123 567 - [[Sacala]]
	- You should end up again with your right hand on your right shoulder ([[Corona Finish]] for me) - like before
- 123 567 - Do the whole cross, [[Gancho]] and [[Corona Finish]] for her
	- You can keep doing this more times or exit
- 123 - Exit with [[Dile Que No]]
	- Hand still around her head
- 567 - [[Coca-Cola]]
	- Let go of the hand around her head at the last moment
### Follower
- 
## ✨ Variations
### From Sacala
- 123 567 - Do a normal [[Sacala]] (Can be with left or right hand)
	- 7 - Ask for the other hand
		- If you did the move with the right hand you will have to switch
- 123 567 - Do the [[Sacala]] with both hands
- You end up in the position ([[Corona Finish]] for me) to do the rest of the move 
### On Spot (Unsure ?)
- 123 567 - [[Vuelta]] on spot
- 123 - I do 180° and roll in (Right hand on my right shoulder)
- 567 - Continue turn towards follower
	- 5 - With [[Gancho]]
- 123 - Micro basic
- 567 - [[Sacala]] / [[Vuelta]]
- TODO: Exit somewhere with [[Enchufla]]
