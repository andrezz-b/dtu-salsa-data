## ✍️ Description & Execution
- This is a [[Role Switch]] move
- Counting will be done as normal, this may cause the counting to shift by 4 counts after a role switch
### Leader
- Get into [[Dile Que No Position]]
- 123 - Start [[Sacala]]
- 567 - Don't step back but forward, and do half [[Espejo]] (left turn 180°) under the hand
- 123 - You are now the *follower*
	- The *leader* should pull you to their side and go from there
	- If they do not start leading (pulling), abandon and go to [[Enchufla]]
### Follower
- 123 - Leader starts [[Sacala]]
- 567 - Normally finish [[Sacala]], notice that leader goes forwards
- 123 - You are now the *leader*
	- You have the *followers* right hand
	- Pull the *follower* to your side
	- 3 - Right hand on *followers* shoulder
---
- This can be looped as you end in [[Dile Que No Position]]
	- A funny combo is to do 2 switches (follower cooperates) into [[Nudo Complicado]]
