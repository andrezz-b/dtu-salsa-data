## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- 123 - [[Enchufla]] start but left down right up
	- She does [[Setenta]] spin but anti-clockwise
	- She should do around 180°, you meet her on the other side because of [[Enchufla]]
- 567 - [[Ronde]] for me
	- I signal her to do a [[Vuelta]] while doing my [[Ronde]]
	- Palm up, don't hold (it won't work), *catch* hand on the way down
- 123 - Walk in this position
- 5 - Keep pulling her, but I kind of stop
- 67 - Sharp [[Espejo]]
- End with [[Enchufla]] [[Ronde]]
---
- This is the core of the move, when called it might consider doing a [[Setenta]] and then during after the [[Enchufla]] you go into this
