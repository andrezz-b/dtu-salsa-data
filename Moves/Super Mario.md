## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- 123 567 123 - [[Setenta Complicado]]
	- My hand should go down at the end, not stay up in front of her face
	- There should be some hand adjustment during the last 123 for this to work
- 567 - [[Ronde]] with hands down
- 123 - I go under, keep pulling her
- 567 - Keep pulling into [[Corona Finish]] for me
- 8 - Start lift both hands up
	- Early is better to have time
- 12 - Hands should peak, and should start putting them down
	- Do not walk much to keep close
	- She should turn, you are back to back
- 3 - The hands go down
	- During the hand going down process switch left hand to palm up hold (**VERY HARD**)
- 567 - Lift left over your head
	- You are in [[Hammerlock]]
- 123 - [[Enchufla]]
- 567 - Hand on shoulder [[Ronde]] into finish

- The hardest part is the hands going up and left hand transition - good way to practice that part is [[Setenta y Uno]] as it ends in [[Corona Finish]]
